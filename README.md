# II Agent

II-Agent is an open-source intelligent assistant designed to streamline and enhance workflows across multiple domains. It represents a significant advancement in how we interact with technology—shifting from passive tools to intelligent systems capable of independently executing complex tasks.

## Introduction
https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d0eb7440-a6e2-4276-865c-a1055181bb33


## Overview

II Agent is built around providing an agentic interface to Anthropic Claude models. It offers:

- A CLI interface for direct command-line interaction
- A WebSocket server that powers a modern React-based frontend
- Integration with Google Cloud's Vertex AI for API access to Anthropic models

## Core Capabilities

II-Agent is a versatile open-source assistant built to elevate your productivity across domains:

| Domain | What II‑Agent Can Do |
|--------|----------------------|
| Research & Fact‑Checking | Multistep web search, source triangulation, structured note‑taking, rapid summarization |
| Content Generation | Blog & article drafts, lesson plans, creative prose, technical manuals, Website creations |
| Data Analysis & Visualization | Cleaning, statistics, trend detection, charting, and automated report generation |
| Software Development | Code synthesis, refactoring, debugging, test‑writing, and step‑by‑step tutorials across multiple languages |
| Workflow Automation | Script generation, browser automation, file management, process optimization |
| Problem Solving | Decomposition, alternative‑path exploration, stepwise guidance, troubleshooting |

## Methods

The II-Agent system represents a sophisticated approach to building versatile AI agents. Our methodology centers on:

1. **Core Agent Architecture and LLM Interaction**
   - System prompting with dynamically tailored context
   - Comprehensive interaction history management
   - Intelligent context management to handle token limitations
   - Systematic LLM invocation and capability selection
   - Iterative refinement through execution cycles

2. **Planning and Reflection**
   - Structured reasoning for complex problem-solving
   - Problem decomposition and sequential thinking
   - Transparent decision-making process
   - Hypothesis formation and testing

3. **Execution Capabilities**
   - File system operations with intelligent code editing
   - Command line execution in a secure environment
   - Advanced web interaction and browser automation
   - Task finalization and reporting
   - Specialized capabilities for various modalities (Experimental) (PDF, audio, image, video, slides)
   - Deep research integration

4. **Context Management**
   - Token usage estimation and optimization
   - Strategic truncation for lengthy interactions
   - File-based archival for large outputs

5. **Real-time Communication**
   - WebSocket-based interface for interactive use
   - Isolated agent instances per client
   - Streaming operational events for responsive UX

## GAIA Benchmark Evaluation

II-Agent has been evaluated on the GAIA benchmark, which assesses LLM-based agents operating within realistic scenarios across multiple dimensions including multimodal processing, tool utilization, and web searching.

We identified several issues with the GAIA benchmark during our evaluation:

- **Annotation Errors**: Several incorrect annotations in the dataset (e.g., misinterpreting date ranges, calculation errors)
- **Outdated Information**: Some questions reference websites or content no longer accessible
- **Language Ambiguity**: Unclear phrasing leading to different interpretations of questions

Despite these challenges, II-Agent demonstrated strong performance on the benchmark, particularly in areas requiring complex reasoning, tool use, and multi-step planning.

## Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- Node.js 18+ (for frontend)
- Google Cloud project with Vertex AI API enabled or Anthropic API key

## Environment

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:

```bash
# Image and Video Generation Tool
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
OPENAI_AZURE_ENDPOINT=your_azure_endpoint
# Search Provider
TAVILY_API_KEY=your_tavily_key
#JINA_API_KEY=your_jina_key
#FIRECRAWL_API_KEY=your_firecrawl_key
# For Image Search and better search results use SerpAPI
#SERPAPI_API_KEY=your_serpapi_key 

STATIC_FILE_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000/

#If you are using Anthropic client
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=
#If you are using Goolge Vertex (recommended if you have permission extra throughput)
#GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=
```

### Frontend Environment Variables

For the frontend, create a `.env` file in the frontend directory:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
```

## Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Set up Python environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -e .
   ```

3. Set up frontend (optional):
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```

## Usage

### Command Line Interface

If you want to use anthropic client, set `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in `.env` file and run:
```bash
python cli.py 
```

If you want to use vertex, set `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` in `.env` file and run:
```bash
python cli.py --project-id YOUR_PROJECT_ID --region YOUR_REGION
```

Options:
- `--project-id`: Google Cloud project ID
- `--region`: Google Cloud region (e.g., us-east5)
- `--workspace`: Path to the workspace directory (default: ./workspace)
- `--needs-permission`: Require permission before executing commands
- `--minimize-stdout-logs`: Reduce the amount of logs printed to stdout

### Web Interface

1. Start the WebSocket server:

When using Anthropic client:
```bash
export STATIC_FILE_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000
python ws_server.py --port 8000
```

When using Vertex:
```bash
export STATIC_FILE_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000
python ws_server.py --port 8000 --project-id YOUR_PROJECT_ID --region YOUR_REGION
```

2. Start the frontend (in a separate terminal):

```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

3. Open your browser to http://localhost:3000

## Project Structure

- `cli.py`: Command-line interface
- `ws_server.py`: WebSocket server for the frontend
- `src/ii_agent/`: Core agent implementation
  - `agents/`: Agent implementations
  - `llm/`: LLM client interfaces
  - `tools/`: Tool implementations
  - `utils/`: Utility functions

## Conclusion

The II-Agent framework, architected around the reasoning capabilities of large language models like Claude 3.7 Sonnet, presents a comprehensive and robust methodology for building versatile AI agents. Through its synergistic combination of a powerful LLM, a rich set of execution capabilities, an explicit mechanism for planning and reflection, and intelligent context management strategies, II-Agent is well-equipped to address a wide spectrum of complex, multi-step tasks. Its open-source nature and extensible design provide a strong foundation for continued research and development in the rapidly evolving field of agentic AI.

## Acknowledgement

We would like to express our sincere gratitude to the following projects and individuals for their invaluable contributions that have helped shape this project:

- **AugmentCode**: We have incorporated and adapted several key components from the [AugmentCode project](https://github.com/augmentcode/augment-swebench-agent). AugmentCode focuses on SWE-bench, a benchmark that tests AI systems on real-world software engineering tasks from GitHub issues in popular open-source projects. Their system provides tools for bash command execution, file operations, and sequential problem-solving capabilities designed specifically for software engineering tasks.

- **Manus**: Our system prompt architecture draws inspiration from Manus's work, which has helped us create more effective and contextually aware AI interactions.

- **Index Browser Use**: We have built upon and extended the functionality of the [Index Browser Use project](https://github.com/lmnr-ai/index/tree/main), particularly in our web interaction and browsing capabilities. Their foundational work has enabled us to create more sophisticated web-based agent behaviors.
